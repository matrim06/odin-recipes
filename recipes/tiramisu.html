	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>300 g (about 30) Savoiardi Ladyfingers.</li>
	<li>500 g (1,1 lb = 2 1/4 cups) of mascarpone cheese.</li>
	<li>4 medium eggs</li>
	<li>100 g (1/2 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
	<li>300 ml (1 ¼ cup) of coffee (better if espresso)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons of Rum or Marsala</li>
	<li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	
	<ol>
	<li>First of all, make the coffee. For a quick
		and delicious Italian coffee,
		we used an Espresso Machine. Then add 2 tablespoons
		of Rum or Marsala wine.</li>
	<li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks.
		Set aside the yolks and whip the egg whites
		until stiff: you will get at it when the the
		egg whites will not move if you turn the bowl over.</li>
	<li>Now, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until
		light and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl
		and work it with a spoon to make it softer.</li>
	<li>Using the flexible-edge k-beater, slowly whip
		the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes.
		Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites.</li>
	<li>Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up.
		Mix slowly until smooth and creamy.</li>
	<li>ow let’s prepare the layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream.
		You can make 2 or more layers, depending on the width and depth
		of your pan.</li>
	<li>Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole.
		Then spread the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.</li>
	<li>Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone cream.</li>
	<li>Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder. You can even add dark chocolate chips, if you like.</li>
	</ol>
