	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>Stuffed peppers hold a special place in our heart.
	   From cheesesteak stuffed peppers to vegetarian stuffed peppers,
	   this versatile veggie is one of our favorites to experiment with.</p>
	   
	<p>Strong enough to hold their shape, peppers are large enough to
	   hold a decent amount of filling while taking to a variety of flavors—they're the perfect vessel
	   for a variety of fillings and ingredients.</p>
